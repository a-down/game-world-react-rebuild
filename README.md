# Game World (React rebuild of [GameVerseHub](https://github.com/a-down/GameVerseHub))

I created Game World to build GameVerseHub with a more appropriate tech stack with React. 

```md
GameVerseHub was a team project during my Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp. It was a site built fo rusers to look up video games and see details about the games. When users searched for a games, `JavaScript (jQuery)` would take a search term entered by the user, make a fetch call to the `RAWG API`, and append cards with the search results to the page. Because of the reactive nature of the site, I wanted to build the webpage with React. 
```

Game world was built to meet a MVP of:
- the user will be met with a landing page
- the landing page will have a carousel of featured games
- the user can filter the featured games carousel by the past year, month, or week
- the user can navigate to the search page with a navigation dropdown
- the user can search by game title
- the user can filter their search with a dropdown menu
- when the user searches a game title, they will see game cards matching the description render beneath the search form
- the game card will show each game's title and an image of the game
- the user can click on the game card to see a modal with futher game details
- the user will see the game's title, rating, description, and additional images
- past searches of the user will be saved to local storage
- the user will see their 5 most recent searches rendered beneath the search form
- the recent searches will update when the user makes a new search
- the user can search a previous search by clicking on the previous search
